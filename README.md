Repository
https://github.com/rslaughter12/ORM-V.2

The repository for this project can be found using the link above.
There were not many pushed to it because it was not needed for this project because there was a lot of started code. 
Also as indicated by the V.2 in the link I restarted this activity because I was having trouble with the first one but was able to use the first one as a guide to complete this one.

Description
This module consisted of creating a functioning backend for an ecommerce website. This include creating a database using mySQL and using sequelize to create models and associations. The database was seeded with data and the backend was tested using postman. During this activity there was a need for api routes to be created and tested. As well as making sure that the models and associations were correct and working properly.
Now that it is complete the user/owner of this ecommerce buisness can add, update, and delete products, categories, and tags. All of the data is stored in a database and can be accessed through the api routes.


Usage
This application is used to create a database for an ecommerce website. The database is seeded with data and the backend is tested using postman.
